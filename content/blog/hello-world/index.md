A new year, a new blog. To get back into the habit of writing regularly again after a pretty long hitiatus,
I finally fixed my blog. As always, the content will be rather random, but somewhat
about software, remote working and making cider.

Since I have been using React a bit recently, this blog is now powered by Gatsby.
